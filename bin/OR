Write the union of unsorted files to STDOUT.

  This script is simply a shortcut to:

    sort -u <file1> <file2>

  This means applying the set operation OR to the files, like
    <file1> OR <file2>

  Entire lines are considered as the key. Both files may contain duplicates.
  

Usage

  OR <file1> <file2>

  OR -h | --help
  

Example

  cat file1
1
2
3
1 

  cat file2
3
4

  OR file1 file2
1
2
3
4

EOF
}


# Read command line arguments
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "ERROR: Mandatory argument(s) missing. Try '${0} --help'" >&2
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$1" = "-h" ] || [ "$1" = "--help" ]
then
    PrintHelp
    exit 0
fi

file1="$1"
shift
if [ $# -gt 0 ]
then
	file2="$1"
else
	echo "ERROR: Missing argument <file2>" >&2
exit 1
fi

sort -u "$file1" "$file2"
