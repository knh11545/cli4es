Write the difference of unsorted files to STDOUT.

  This script is simply a shortcut to:

    sort <file1> | uniq | sort <file2> <file2> - | uniq -u

  This means applying the set operation NOT to the files, like
    <file1> NOT <file2>

  Entire lines are considered as the key. Both files may contain duplicates.
  

Usage

  NOT <file1> <file2>

  NOT -h | --help
  

Examples

  cat file1
1
2
3
1 

  cat file2
3
4

  NOT file1 file2
1
2

  NOT file2 file1
4
