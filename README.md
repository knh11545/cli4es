Command line tools for expert searchers
==============================================================================

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/knh11545/cli4es/HEAD)

This is a demo site for a small collection of tools that I use. Some originally came from [here](https://github.com/knh11545/commandline4expertsearchers). The tools itself are contained in the [bin](bin/) folder.

In addition, when launching this repository in [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) the [Entrez Direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) tools from NLM are installed (see the [postBuild](.binder/postBuild) file). They can be used in a terminal or in a Jupyter notebook. **Please, act responsible when using resources of mybinder.org and NLM and do obeye their usage guidelines!** For the Entrez API see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/#chapter2.Usage_Guidelines_and_Requiremen).

[This notebook](fetch_mesh_entry_terms.ipynb) is a demo of a tool to fetch MeSH entry terms via API from the commandline.

Currently, this is also a testbed on how to deploy a work environment.
